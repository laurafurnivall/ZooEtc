# ZooEtc
## Full Stack Capstone for NSS

Zoo Etc. is a catch all resource application for zoo professionals looking for the best zoos to work at and the best gear to buy. 
It allows users to rate and review both zoos and gear, peruse job listings, and make educated decisions about their career.

### Who is it for?

Any zoo professional looking looking to make educated decisions about their career or peruse resources that help make their worklife easier. 

### Why do I need it?

After being apart of the zoo community for over ten years, I heard continuous conversations about:<BR>

 • What is the best gear to buy?<BR>
 • What does each zoo has to offer to their employees? <BR>
 • What's the best enrichment to give to a certain species? <BR>
 • What browse is given to which species? <BR>
 • And where to find other meaningful resources to zoo professionals?<BR>
  
With those conversations, I had the idea to create a one stop shop of resources for zoo professionals. 
The idea of Zoo Etc. was born years before I followed the path of a software developer out of that need, and being able to execute a base version of it, with the potential to grow it more, is truly exciting. 

So, with all that said, if you work in the zoo world, this application is for you.

### Difficulties and Challenges
1. The biggest challenge was my planned MVP was large, and so finding the time to finish what was promised was difficult.
2. As far as actual programming went, this project really honed my comprehension of how server side and client side meet. In previous course work, I struggled with that, and I feel like the repetitive nature of creating multiple CRUD functualties for different objects really helped cement my understanding.
3. Another challenge was just feeling confident in my understanding, my knowledge is at a base level, so I definitely took opportunities during downtime to research concepts I did't understand as well and often left notes within my code to step through some of those moments.
