# ZooEtc
##Full Stack Capstone for NSS

Zoo Etc. is a catch all resource application for zoo professionals looking for the best zoos to work at and the best gear to buy. 
It allows users to rate and review both zoos and gear, peruse job listings, and make educated decisions about their career.

### Who is it for?

Any zoo professional looking looking to make educated decisions about their career or peruse resources that help make their worklife easier. 

### Why do I need it?

After being apart of the zoo community for over ten years and hearing continuous conversations about what is the best gear to buy, what each
zoo has to offer to their employees, what's the best enrichment to give to a certain species, what browse is given to which species and where to find 
other meaningful resources, I had the idea to create a one stop shop of resources for zoo professionals. The idea of Zoo Etc. was born years before I 
followed the path of a software developer out of that need, and being able to execute a base version of it, with the potential to grow it more, is truly exciting.
